Decentralized AI-Powered Sports Betting Clearinghouse

A full-stack Web3 + AI platform that models sports betting as a financial clearing and portfolio management system. The project combines blockchain smart contracts for trustless settlement with machine-learning–based predictive analytics to evaluate betting decisions as probabilistic investments.

Think Robinhood-style portfolio tracking, but for sports betting — powered by AI decision intelligence and blockchain-backed execution.

Project Overview

Traditional sports betting platforms are opaque, fragmented, and centralized. This project re-imagines sports betting infrastructure as a decentralized clearinghouse, where:

Bets are locked, settled, and audited on-chain

Outcomes are resolved via oracle-style administration

Wagers are tracked as portfolio assets with exposure and PnL

AI models provide probabilistic forecasts and edge analysis

The result is a transparent, trustless, and data-driven betting system that mirrors principles from quantitative finance and financial market infrastructure.

Blockchain Layer (Clearinghouse)
Smart Contract: BettingClearinghouse.sol

Responsibilities:

Accept and lock ETH wagers

Store bets immutably on-chain

Resolve outcomes (oracle/admin)

Automatically pay winners

Support emergency refunds

Key Concepts:

Wagers = collateralized positions

Settlement = trustless execution

Contract = financial clearinghouse analogue

Deployed using Hardhat + Ethers.js on Ethereum testnet.

AI Prediction Engine

The AI layer provides decision support, not automation.

Models Used:

Logistic Regression

Poisson Models

(Optional) XGBoost

Outputs:

Win probabilities

Expected value (EV)

Model odds vs market odds

Suggested betting edge

This mirrors how quantitative trading models analyze risk and return in financial markets.

Frontend (Portfolio Dashboard)

Built with React and MetaMask integration, the UI allows users to:

Connect a Web3 wallet

Place on-chain bets

View active and settled positions

Track bets like financial assets

Compare AI predictions to market odds

The UX is intentionally designed to resemble a financial portfolio dashboard rather than a traditional sportsbook.

Why This Project Matters

This project demonstrates:

Blockchain systems design

AI-driven decision modeling

Financial market analogies

End-to-end full-stack engineering

It is not a sportsbook — it is Web3 financial infrastructure applied to sports markets.
